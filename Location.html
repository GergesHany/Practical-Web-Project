                        Dubai is an ideal holiday destination for families, with theme parks,
                        beaches, Friday brunches and more to keep everyone happy. The famous 
                        Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, is well worth the entrance fee.
                        Burj Al-Arab, often touted as the world's only 7-star hotel, remains underwhelming.
                        Similarly, the Aquaventure Water Park at the Palms Atlantis Hotel is not to be missed. 
                        Jumeriah Beach Residence is well established as Dubai's most popular beachfront, and 
                        its close proximity to a whole host of restaurants, cafes and shops make it more than worthy of its status.
